# Java-Arrays
1.	You are given an array of String[] animals = {“Cat”, “Dog”, “Cow”, “Hamster”, “Horse”, “Lion”, “Bear”, “Rhino”, “Elephant”, “Tiger”, “Eagle”}.


	a.	Create an ArrayList object and read into this object the items from the array. Print the list and size of list.
  
  
	b.	Create an array of String of 3 animals you want to remove and read it into an ArrayList called removeAnimals. Then use the removeAnimals list to delete these animals from the original ArrayList. Print the list and its size again. 
  
  
  
2.	Repeat the first exercise with LinkedList.
  
  
	a.	After you have done parts (a) and (b) from question 1 for LinkedList, traverse the LinkedList in reverse order and convert capital letters to lowercase. Print the list and its size. The output should be in reverse order of the actual input list.
  
  
	b.	Convert the LinkedList of 2 (a) to an array and print.
